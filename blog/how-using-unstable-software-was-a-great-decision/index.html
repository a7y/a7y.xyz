         <h1>How using unstable software was a great decision</h1>
         <p>I use <a href="http://laravel.com/">Laravel</a>. It is an extremely popular PHP framework, and it has the definite right to be. Laravel is simply a pleasure to work with.</p>

<p>About 4 months ago I started planning a new project. I had to make the important decision of whether or not to use the unstable, not-even-beta Laravel 5, or the tried and true Laravel 4. I ended up choosing 5 for a couple of reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>Its release date (4 months ago) was set for December. I was sure I wouldn&rsquo;t have finished development by then anyway.</li>
<li>Even the 5 or 6 new features shown back then were extremely attractive. Method injection, request classes, and the new directory structure were some of the few. <em>n.b. present-day Laravel 5 has a much larger list of stellar improvements.</em></li>
<li>I am a sucker for bleeding edge software. Just consult my loyalty to Arch Linux.</li>
</ul>

<p>I realized that the absolute worst that could happen was an increased requirement of <em>time</em>. A serious liability for teams and corporations, but thankfully, a non-issue for me. I&rsquo;m working alone, and hence, set my own pace and deadlines.</p>

<p>Going for Laravel 5 was seriously a fantastic decision. I cannot express the amount of progress I&rsquo;ve made in regard to my code and the way I conceptualize projects. I would go so far as to say that every pitfall associated with alpha-software resulted in either the improvement or learning of a skill.</p>

<p><strong>Documentation</strong> was virtually non-existent. If I didn&rsquo;t know how to use a feature, the only option I had was to read through Taylor Otwell&rsquo;s code. This went to great lengths in improving my understanding of a number of design patterns, and of course, the Laravel internals.</p>

<p>A <strong>changelog</strong> was also absent. A nice-looking markdown document with functionality changes and improvements? Nope. Everyone got the commit list and file diffs. If something broke that worked previous to a <em>&gt; composer update</em>, I went to GitHub and looked at what Taylor pushed.</p>

<p>Constant <strong>additions, reversions, and revisions</strong> kept me on my feet, or rather, in my chair. Especially with the changes to convention, it was a rare week when I hadn&rsquo;t <a href="https://twitter.com/alextyrey/status/557281374131208192">refactored anything</a>. I can definitely understand why people would loathe this, but I&rsquo;d be lying through my teeth if I said it didn&rsquo;t result in the betterment of my code.</p>

<p><strong>Bugs</strong> in the framework? I either fixed them myself or waited for someone else to do so. Doing the former, I can truthfully say that a project with 14k+ stars on GitHub incorporates code I wrote. Although insignificant when compared to others&rsquo; contributions, it&rsquo;s a great feeling regardless.</p>

<p>So overall, I firmly believe I made the right choice. I maintain the notion that unstable software is horrible for production. However, it now carries the exception that it&rsquo;s incredible for personal-growth.</p>

<p>Now if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, <a href="https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/6941">I need to go make my code PSR-2 compliant</a>.</p>
