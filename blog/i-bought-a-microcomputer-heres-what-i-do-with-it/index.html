         <h1>I bought a microcomputer. Here&#39;s what I do with it</h1>
         <p>If you&rsquo;re reading this blog, you&rsquo;re surely familiar with the RaspberryPi, a ~$30 microcomputer. Only, I didn&rsquo;t buy the RaspberryPi, I bought the <a href="http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G141578608433">ODROID-C1</a> by HardKernel for $35.</p>

<p>The C1 has 4 cores, generously provided by the Amlogic S805 SoC with ARMv7 architecture, and 1GB of DDR3 RAM. As opposed to the RaspberryPi B+, which is also $35, having only 1 core on ARMv6 architecture and 512MB of DDR2 RAM.</p>

<p><img src="http://dn.odroid.com/homebackup/201411171955007939.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Obviously this is an enormous performance boost for no price difference at all. What&rsquo;s the downside? The RaspberryPi is <em>much</em> more widely supported than any other microcomputer on the market. The Linux kernel actually incorporates a number of improvements affecting the RaspberryPi. This is more than can be said about HardKernel&rsquo;s products and other RaspberryPi competitors.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this downside doesn&rsquo;t really matter to me. My plan was to set up a non-critical homeserver, hence, I went ahead and got the most bang for my buck. And although I&rsquo;ve only had the unit for about a week, I&rsquo;m very happy with my decision.</p>

<p>HardKernel allows you to purchase a microSD card (or, alternatively, an eMMC module) with either Android or Ubuntu preinstalled. Android wouldn&rsquo;t have been a good choice for what I wanted to use the C1 for, and I&rsquo;m not a fan of Ubuntu. However, I am a huge Arch Linux fanboy.</p>

<p>The independent <a href="http://archlinuxarm.org/">ALARM</a> (Arch Linux ARM) project was organized to support systems containing an ARM CPU, such as the RaspberryPi and the ODROID-C1.</p>

<p>Even as an Arch fanboy, I would be the first to tell you to not use Arch Linux in mission-critical situations. Just like most other rolling-release distributions, it&rsquo;s simply too unstable to be used in an uptime-dependent context.</p>

<p>But as I said previously, uptime is not an enormous liability for the type of usage I had in mind.</p>

<p>I currently serve data over 3 different protocols with my C1:</p>

<p><strong>NTP</strong> - Every computer in my house now has its clock synchronized with eachother, down to a fraction of a second. The C1 supports an optional RTC (real-time clock) battery which made the board a perfect candidate for serving time.</p>

<p><strong>HTTP</strong> - I&rsquo;m debating getting rid of this because I don&rsquo;t use it often, but I currently serve an instance of <a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki">Dokuwiki</a> to use personally. It sounds useful as hell, having your own personal wiki to document everything.</p>

<p>The problem is that I&rsquo;m too lazy to actually document anything. Furthermore, my usage of <a href="https://trello.com/alextyrey/recommend">Trello</a> makes the wiki almost a redundancy.</p>

<p><strong>DNS</strong> - I use a package called <em>Dnsmasq</em> to cache and serve DNS queries. Even though lookup time is boosted by more than 100%, this process only decreases the total connection time by, on average, 100ms.</p>

<p>The real advantage to doing this, however, is the fact that I can set up locally resolvable domain names. For example, wiki.local resolves to the wiki mentioned above.</p>

<p>After a week of ownership, I am incredibly happy with the product and its performance. I&rsquo;m glad to say that ALARM and the board itself have both been working flawlessly. And with only ~80MB of memory being consumed, I have plenty of room for expansion.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be sure to write a new post if I do anything else worth mentioning with the C1. I highly recommend the board if you have a similar use-case.</p>
