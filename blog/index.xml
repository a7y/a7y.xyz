      <description>I use Laravel. It is an extremely popular PHP framework, and it has the definite right to be. Laravel is simply a pleasure to work with.

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this blog, you&amp;rsquo;re surely familiar with the RaspberryPi, a ~$30 microcomputer. Only, I didn&amp;rsquo;t buy the RaspberryPi, I bought the ODROID-C1 by HardKernel for $35.
The C1 has 4 cores, generously provided by the Amlogic S805 SoC with ARMv7 architecture, and 1GB of DDR3 RAM. As opposed to the RaspberryPi B+, which is also $35, having only 1 core on ARMv6 architecture and 512MB of DDR2 RAM.</description>

For example: film speed is defined by ISO 6, 2240, and 5800. And the file extension .ISO (used for disk images) pays homage to ISO 9660. Country (&amp;ldquo;us&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;uk&amp;rdquo;) and language codes (&amp;ldquo;en&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;es&amp;rdquo;) stem from ISO 3166 and 639 respectively.</description>
